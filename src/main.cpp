/*
Tachometer using micros

On this sketch we are going to measure the period between pulses using the micros() function to get the RPM
(Revolutions Per Minute) from a sensor on pin 2.
This way of measuring RPM makes it accurate, responsive and versatile. No matter how fast or slow the loop is
running, the reading accuracy is not going to be affected. Although, the faster you run the loop, the more amount
of readings you are going to be able to display every second.

It's coded in a way that the micros rollover doesn't create glitches every 71 minutes, so it can run forever
without problems.

We use an interrupt for the input so you have to choose pin 2 or 3 (for Arduino Uno/nano). In this example we
use pin 2.

///OLED 0.96" Display:
We are going to use the OLED 128x64 I2C with SSD1306 driver using the Adafruit library.

Pins for OLED display and arduino uno/nano:
 * GND = GND
 * VCC = 5V
 * SCL = A5
 * SDA = A4
 

It's a good idea to put a resistor between A4-5V and A5-5V to help stabilize the connection.
What that does is pull-up the I2C pins to make it more reliable and prevents lock-ups.

Libraries needed for the OLED display:

// The higher the set value, the longer lag/delay will have to sense that pulses stopped, but it will allow readings
